Taws
====

Taws is an attempt for a personal and anonymous web search engine. 
When a user tries to search using an engine( google ), 
that user should know for a fact that no data is being stored remotely without their consent. 
This is what Taws tries to fix, but it has a big challenge ahead.

Basicly Taws is a search engine that you will own.
You can put it on one main computer and that will supply 
service to all of your devices. You'll also need the 
crawler database(search) that is done by Genaside(me).

Here are some other perks
-------------------------
* No ads, no ads, did I mention no ads?
* You can have any type of database you want. 
  For example, you can have an english only with no porn.
  You can have a japanese only search database, It's up to you.
* If you load the search database, that's it. 
  You can even do your seaching offline, becuase 
  the actual searching doesn't use the internet.
  However, you may need to go online to visit the links of search results.
* You can do "needle in haystack"
* I don't crawl Tor sites, but i'll link to anyone that does. 
  There can be other sources to get the database besides just me.

Some downsides
--------------
* No storage for images or videos, meaning there is no section for 
  image searching.( still wondering about this )
* Database can get very big for for you. 7gb is what I think it 
  should get for a great english database. besides, some games are this size anyways.
* If a url becomes unvisted for a while by the crawler, the url will get removed. 
  This affects future downloads
* If ubm( the pairing of user query to reselt ) doesn't get match often
  the ubm entry will be removed. This affects future downloads

Some notes for the user
-----------------------
* This is a beta or think of it as a little baby that 
  has a lot to learn, so it can grow up being great. 
  So please send my ideas and support.
* The Database isn't that big yet( < 4GB). I want to get the 
  english over 3GB and the whole database over 100GB. 
  I will need the communities help on this.
